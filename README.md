# PowerBI_SuperStore_Sales_Dashboard_Project
I created a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze SuperStore sales data, providing key insights into various aspects of sales performance. The dashboard includes visualizations for:

Sales by Payment Mode: Breakdown of sales through COD, Online, and Card payments.
Sales by Region: Distribution of sales across West, East, South, and Central regions.
Sales by Segment: Comparison of sales contributions from Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments.
Monthly Sales and Profit Trends: Trends in sales and profit over months for 2019 and 2020.
Sales by Shipping Mode: Evaluation of sales through different shipping methods.
Sales by Category and Sub-Category: Detailed sales performance by product categories and sub-categories.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Metrics such as returns, total sales, profit, orders, and average delivery time.
